# Square(n) Sum
https://www.codewars.com/kata/515e271a311df0350d00000f/train/javascript
## Instruction:
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for ```[1, 2, 2]``` it should ```return 9``` because ```1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.```
